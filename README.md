# md_viscoplastic

The md_viscoplastic software is a numerical implementation of the Munson-Dawson material model for rock salt.  One inputs a deformation increment, a temperature increment, and the current stress state to md_viscoplastic.  It returns the new stress state by numerically integrating ordinary differential equations.
